      <h2>Rating food from three different countries around the world! </h2>
      <p>We are going to be rating the food from Georgia and Spain, two nations at the complete opposite ends of Europe. Some would argue that Georgia is actually Asia aswell but I think it's a strong mix of both. To bo be able to do this we are going to rank on 5 different catagories. These shall be portability, flavour, spice level, healthiness,and finally uniqueness.</p> 
        <h3>Contenders</h3>
        <ul>
         <li>Georgia</li>

        <h3>Georgia</h3>
          <p>Georgia's food is an absolute delight. It is entirely unique and features such an incredible blend of Silk Road flavours. From the mountains of Svaneti to the streets of Tbilisi the country has an stupendous array of foods that will blow your mind. The country is truly fantastic and I couldn't recommend going enough. The entire nation is a delight and the food is one of the wonders of the world. <br /><br /> <strong>Georgia's 5 must try dishes</strong> </p>
           <ul>
            <li>Khachapuri</li>
             <p>Khachapuri is a dish made with bread, cheese and egg. There are at least 9 distinctive regional varients of the dish including two from the occupied states of Abkhazia and Ossetia. It is a dish which has been inscribed on the list of the intangible cultura heritage of Georgia and is also the nation's national dish. My personal favourite is the Adjarian.</p>

            <li>Khinkali</li>
             <p>Khinkali is Georgia's answer to the dumpling. Commonly filled with beef, pork, potato, or cheese it is one of the most common dishes in the country. It's also incredibly cheap averaging £0.15 for a large dumpling. Be sure to remember the best method for eating them! Bit a small hole in them, suck the juices out and then eat the dumpling!</p>

            <li>Alcohol</li>
             <p>Georgia has a wine industry dating back roughly 10,000 years. It also has a bustling spirit called Chacha which is a strong liquer made from the pomace of grapes. It can regularly be over 60% alcohol so it is very strong! The various local brandy's are very high quality aswell. Watch out France!</p>

            <li>Shashlik</li>
             <p>Shashlik is a cubed meat Kebab that is popular all over the former Soviet Union. It is truly delicious and you will honestly want to never stop eating them!</p>

            <li>Lobiani</li>
             <p>The lobiani is a bean filled bread pastry that is absolutely devine when warm. The bean filling is seasoned very well and this is truly a dish to savour.</p>

       <h3>Spain</h3>
        <p> Spain's food is well known across the globe. It combines hearty ingredients with a mediterrean flair. The food changes by region but there are some mainstays which have become part of the Spanish legacy. One thing to note is the importance of olive oil. Spain is the world's biggest producer of olive oil and it is used in many dishes. <br /><br /> <strong>Spain's 5 must try dishes</strong> </p>

           <li>Churros</li>
            <p>Churros are a sugary delight. A deep fried yeasty dough, covered in sugar and occasionally eaten with melted chocolate, they are truly spectacular. Commonly eaten at breakfast with a strong cup of coffee. </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>To conclude both of these nations have absolutely incredible cuisines. They both came out with 34/50 on our rating scale which means we have a draw in our first match up. The character of Georgian food is genuinely divine and I couldn't recommend this amazing country more. It is a true gem. Spain on the other hand is incredibly popular with tourists and for a good reason. The food lights up your soul and it matches this beautiful nation incredibly.</P>
